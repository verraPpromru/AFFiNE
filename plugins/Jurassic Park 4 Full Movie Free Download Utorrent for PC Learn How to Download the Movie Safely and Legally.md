## History of Bhrigu Samhita
 
The Bhrigu Samhita is said to be one of the oldest and most comprehensive astrological treatises in India. According to legend, it was compiled by Maharishi Bhrigu, one of the seven great sages of Hinduism, who lived 10,000 years ago and had a divine vision of everyone who was to be born in every country of the world. [^1^] [^2^] He wrote down his predictions on palm leaves and stored them in his ashram near Dhosi Hill. Over time, many of these leaves were lost or destroyed by natural calamities or human interventions. Some of them were also taken away by other sages or astrologers who wanted to study or use them.
 
Today, only a few fragments of the original Bhrigu Samhita are available in different parts of India. Some of them are kept by families or institutions that claim to have inherited them from their ancestors or acquired them from other sources. Some of them are also printed in books or scanned in pdf files that can be accessed online. However, the authenticity and accuracy of these copies are often questionable, as they may have been tampered with or corrupted over time. Moreover, finding the correct leaf for a particular person is not an easy task, as it requires a lot of skill and intuition on the part of the astrologer.
